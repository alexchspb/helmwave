# Contributing Guidelines

The ðŸŒŠ HelmWave project accepts contributions via GitHub pull requests. \
This document outlines the process to help get your contribution accepted.

## Milestones

We use milestones to track the progress of specific planned releases.

## Versioning

We use [semver](https://semver.org/)

## Developing flow

*fix/feature-branch --> release/$SEMVER --> main*

    commit
    commit
    checkout release/0.42.0
    merge feature/a

    commit
```


**Example:**

- feature/000 --> release/0.41.0 --> main

### Non product update

When don't affect any `*.go` files we use [githubFlow](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/github-flow).

`some branch --> main`

### Documentation update

After merging new release branch (minor or major) a new branch and PR in [helmwave/docs](https://github.com/helmwave/docs) will be created automatically. You will need to update documentation (if necessary) and merge this PR into main branch.

### CHANGELOG

We use https://changie.dev to provide changes for users.

Just install this tool

`$ changie new` â€“ it helps you write the changes
